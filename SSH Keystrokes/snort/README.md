# Snort Configuration 

Snort version 2.9.7.0 was used for the collection of the TCP packets (obtained from www.snort.org). Since the server used has Centos 6.5 installed Snort had to be built from source. The RPM binaries available for Centos were for version 7. Installation procedure is described in snort-centos6x-2970.pdf (https://www.snort.org/documents/4)

## Configuration
The etc folder contains:

- init.d snort daemon script
- snort.conf
- file for ssh keystroke logging
